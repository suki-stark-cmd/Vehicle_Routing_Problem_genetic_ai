Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) Solver
Overview
The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a well-known optimization problem in logistics and supply chain management. It involves determining the optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles to service a set of customers, ensuring minimum operational cost while adhering to various constraints such as vehicle capacities and delivery time windows.

This project provides a Python-based solution to VRP using mathematical modeling, heuristic approaches, and visualization tools. The solution framework is scalable and can handle various constraints, making it applicable to real-world scenarios.

Project Goals
Minimize the total travel distance or cost of vehicle routes.
